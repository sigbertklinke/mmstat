# mmstat

__mmstat__ is a R library for supporting our apps in teaching basic statistics. Since it is under development some/a lot of stuff may not work properly.

To run the test apps in RStudio:

```R
  library("mmstat")
  shinyDemo("testHypergeometric.R")
```
  
Please note that we have to types of apps:

* __testXXX__ for testing the functionality of the library
* __mmstatXXX__ for our apps
  
For all available apps see the [demo directory](https://github.com/sigbertklinke/mmstat/tree/master/inst/shiny-demo).
